4th AI-Generated Open-Source Silicon Design Challenge

Generative AI for Energy-Efficient Keyword Spotting Hardware Accelerator Design

Our project proposal focuses on optimizing the performance and energy efficiency of a Keyword Spotting (KWS) accelerator for integration into the Caravel System-on-Chip (SoC) environment. Leveraging generative AI techniques, we aim to enhance both the KWS machine learning model and the audio features extractor, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), to create an energy-efficient solution suitable for various embedded applications.


Our hardware architecture consists of memory, compute, and a controller module that facilitates the detection of a Keyword set by the user. The feature extraction will entail several hardware modules that enable MFCC processing. 

For testing and validation, we will use the following datasets for key word spotting / speach recognition:  
--> (2018) Speech commands dataset version 2. [Online]. Available: http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz  
--> (2017) Speech commands dataset version 1. [Online]. Available: http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz
